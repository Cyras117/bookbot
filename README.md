# 🤖 Bookbot: Text Analysis in Python

Bookbot is a simple Python project that analyzes the contents of a text file (such as a book) and generates statistics about its words and letters. This project is ideal for practicing Python fundamentals, including file I/O, string manipulation, and working with dictionaries.

## 📚 Features

- Counts the total number of words in a text file
- Counts the frequency of each letter (case-insensitive, alphabetic only)
- Outputs results in a readable format

## 🏗️ Project Structure

│
├── bookbot.py         # Main Python script
├── README.md          # Project documentation
└── yourfile.txt       # Sample text file for analysis
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bookbot.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd bookbot
   ```
3. **Place your text file** (e.g., `yourfile.txt`) in the project directory. You can use any text file for analysis.

## 📖 Usage

To run the Bookbot analysis, use the following command:

```bash
python bookbot.py yourfile.txt
```

Replace `yourfile.txt` with the name of your text file. Bookbot will read the file, perform the analysis, and display the results in the terminal.
